The returns and value provided by these companies will be primarily be based on the timing of new production and their asset base and they will realize (on a relative basis) very little from the trading.

Dale Neuner is anxious to resolve the issues surrounding FX transactions on EOL. Have you concluded that we need RMT as the EOL party for internal hedging FX products for London and Japan. Am I correct in the following? RMT will be the party transacting directly with international Enron affiliates (i.e., ECTRIC, through EEFT, and Enron Japan) under new/existing services agreements. ENA will be the financial party transacting directly with third parties. Does ENA also act directly with non-affiliated Japanese customers (if the situation should arise?) Thanks.

We need to communicate with 2 different groups: the Generation Outage Desk and the Real Time Desk. First, we fill out an outage report and send it to the Generation Outage Desk. When the outage is over or the period of the outage changes, we are required to telephone the Real Time Outage Desk. That phone number is 916/351-2488. When the calls come in to Real Time from the ISO asking about the outages, they are following up on reports we have filed to see if our outage is ending as planned. The Services Desk will be responsible for communicating with both the Generation Outage Desk and the Real Time Outage Desk, but Real Time should try to be aware of all outages and be able to communicate with the ISO when they call.

If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle back with Lisa. A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for payment for changes, storage, etc. As far as I know, this concept hasn't been addressed with GE.

That is $5.61 vs $4.61. This assumes we pay a day rate of $50,000/day for the vessel, Jan '02 NYMEX is $5.41, and the FOB price for LNG is $2.66. Let's stay in touch about the possibilty of landing a spot cargo into Puerto Rico in January. As we discussed, how we play this with Cabot is a big issue. There could be an additional $4.7 MM of value that could be captured by Eco if Cabot were unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo. Also, let's continue to think about how we make the logistics work and how we can get Cabot's cooperation if needed.

I did not change the prices, since I had not discussed this with Ben, and couldn't get the numbers to work. Have there been some changes to the data sheets? It appears to me that there might be a version which reflects the inclusion of the low sound option. In the last draft we did not include the low sound option because the impact on the load losses had not been agreed, so the prices did not reflect the option.

At the close of business for the 991 P&L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.

A valve was left open between an LG&E facility and Northern for an approximate 3 month period (I'm not sure how recent). LG&E's gas loss data indicates that the amount of gas that inadvertently got into Northern was approx. 180,000 MMBtu, with a value of about $500,000. Rockey and Steve have talked to LG&E and it does not appear that we have any good arguments for avoiding the liability. The unexpected (and unmetered) deliveries from LG&E presumably reduced our lost and unaccounted for balance during the referenced 3 month period. Accordingly, I assume the cost of replacing that gas should be accounted for in Northern's PRA and so should not affect earnings. I'm not sure what the timetable is for resolving this matter.

We originally thought that this got booked out between Mirant and WAPA, but when I spoke with Kathy yesterday, she informed me that there was no bookout and that they want to cut the schedule. (the people involved during the cut were Geir at EPMI, Bob at PAC, Emily at Mirant, and Jackie for WAPA (Jackie is a control area dispatcher, so she cannot do bookouts for WAPA, hence there was no bookout)). We have agreed that to cut the schedule will be the best for now. They do not plan on charging us LD's (she's checking with her boss to make sure.) We will just reduce the schedules to 25 for HE 11.

However, I wanted to inquire if a reverse stock split (perhaps a 12 to 1 or 15 to 1) was a possible option. My knoweledge in terms of Enron's debt and who we are indebted to is limited to what I have heard through the media, but as I see it, many creditors are at a great risk to lose billions of dollars. Would banks such as JP Morgan or Citigroup or others potentially affected such as Janus Funds or Lehman Brothers be willing to invest in equity rather than pump in more debt? From my understanding, we need an immediate $4 billion, and I think this may be a potential solution to get instant cash, and then we can turn our interests to building customer and investor confidence.

From those meetings, however, I received severely conflicting information and left with a feeling that there are no rules, or that the rules are made and changed from person to person. That being said, does HR follow a set of rules that are standard for all non-exempt promotions to exempt roles? In addition, are qualifications to meet those standards changed with each individual?

In light of this, EC has a contractual obligation to a company called Risk Metrics Group. The obligation arises out of the development and hosting by RMG of a website devoted to the use of EC's credit risk data - the site being mainly focused toward subscribers to other RMG products. Since we are terminating the development and hosting agreement - in essence shutting down the site - we will owe RMG approximately $96,000. While I realize this is a small sum, I wanted to make sure (1) there are no approvals under the merger agreement that are required for a settlement of this nature and (2) if we are tracking this type of liability for merger purposes, that I provide the necessary information to the appropriate personnel.

Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature). Sheri When you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a \"Dateline\" type theme for one, and a \"60 Minute\" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme.

She indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from Dynegy to Enron or vice versa. Of course, such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free-for-all. At a minimum, I would think that you and Andrea Lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions. With that thought, I have asked Tim O'Rourke's team to work on such a protocol. In the meantime, Kristen mentioned that one person in Rick Shapiro's group wants to go to Dynegy. She understood that Shapiro had said it was ok. Do you know about that? If not, should you give Andrea a call about it? I am concerned about the floodgate effect, so I believe we should proceed with extreme caution. Let me know your thoughts on this. Michelle [/INST] 1.

The resulting limits (in kV) are translated into a MW transfer limit for the flowgates affected by the original voltage limit. To the extent that these surrogate limits reflect the expected voltage performance of the system, then SCUC/BME and SCD will secure the system accordingly. These rely on DC powerflow techniques, which by their nature are Blind to voltage problems. When this occurs, OOM is one tool that can be used to secure the system. When the realtime operation deviates from the conditions assumed in the analysis used to determine the voltage limits, the use of OOM and/or other measures may need to taken by the Operators to secure the system I hope this clarifys the situation.
